Getting tired of copy/pasting your LFG messages in General/LFG/Guild? So was I, thus Simple LFG was born.

Slash Commands: /slfg

# Main Frame
**Dungeon**: Select the dungeon you want to use in your messages
**LFG/LFM Tabs**: Changes the frame below based on the active tab
**Message Box (bottom)**: Automatically constructs a message based on the options in the LFG/LFM tabs. Players can manually edit or type their own message entirely.
**Post Button**: Sends whatever message is currently in the Message Box to the selected channels

# LFG Tab
**Role**: Choose what role you are advertising yourself for (Tank, Healer, DPS)
**Add Character Info**: If checked, will automatically add your character's level and class to the message

# LFM Tab
**Need**: Choose how many members you are looking for
**Tank/Healer/DPS**: Check to specify roles you are looking for

# Channel Options
**General**: Current zone's General channel
**LFG**: global LookingForGroup channel
**Guild**: Guild channel
**Empty Box**: Use this to put in your own custom channel (name or number) to send your message to. When ENTER is pressed, it will automatically validate the channel that is typed in. If the text changes to red, then SLFG did not find a valid channel for the info given. The user can still try to click the Post button, but will return an error in the main chat frame.
